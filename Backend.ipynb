One needs to definitely do the homework about knowing the VC. I understand we want to talk to anyone when funds are drying fast but we just have to be prepared for any outcome.

But first reflect on what you could have done differently.', \"Funny story for you.\\n\\nA few years ago, I pitched for an event hosted by one of the top tech companies (their VC arm). This event was extremely public and mega hyped on LinkedIn. We were in the middle of a fundraise with most of it committed at that point. \\n\\nWe had to compete against a YC company. When we practiced our pitch the day before, they listened to our pitch and copied a bunch of my content. ü§°\\n\\nWe ended up losing to a YC company that literally stole our pitch deck, had 0 revenue or traction whatsoever, but they were YC and none of the other competitors were ü•¥. Keep in mind my team was revenue generating (over 1M) with the team to back it. \\n\\nWell, other VC's were at this competition, a bunch pulled out from my round to explore other opportunities with said YC company. I'll never know if they invested or not. \\n\\nMy entire round lost traction because of that stupid competition. One by one every opportunity fell. It was a complete sh*show. \\n\\nThey've picked a YC company every year, I honestly just should've known better. Props to the company that snaked me, that takes skill. I am incredibly jaded towards the industry now and I am definitely not the same person as I was before that pitch. It changes you. \\n\\nAll in, don't sweat one convo, VC's aren't worth stressing over. Bootstrap as much as you can and keep your equity because when you really need your VC's - they won't be there for you.\", 'During my first startup, we had a partner pitch meeting setup via Zoom( during COVID).

I declined repeatedly -- but then ended up losing my voice and needing water in the middle of the pitch\\n* many firms simply ghosted me after meetings that I thought went reasonably well.  my favorites were the ones that ghosted me but added me to their email newsletter lists\\n* VC's who sent me rejection emails even after I was careful to establish up front that I was having an exploratory conversation for a potential future round, not actually fundraising\\n* (this might be my favorite) the second-tier VC's (a number of years ago now) who told me how focused they were on iOS apps -- and promptly pulled their blackberries out during the meeting\", \"VCs are for the most part a joke.

         "Hi folks, looking some perspective here. I have been working on validating a problem for a while now and I am at the point where I want to seriously work on it.\n\nMy day job is running product at a fintech firm, and I am somewhat close to the Founder/CEO. So I approached him about the idea, somewhat naively hoping that I could fish out some pre-seed money. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything really, but figured no harm in asking.\n\nTurns out the CEO is quite interested, but wants to develop it as a new business division. I suppose hindsight, this should have been an obvious potential outcomes.\n\nWhat‚Äôs makes the proposal sensible is that my current firm operates in the same industry, practically serving the same clients albeit on different solutions. Working within the firm would give me access to resources - a technology team to build the product, sales people who are very well connected within the industry, and firm has big-name investors, which could open doors, especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse.\n\nBut, where there is trepidation: my firm is currently stretched across multiple products, and is still searching for product market fit. I‚Äôm afraid that by attaching my idea to a company that is already struggling at prioritizing and gaining traction, I will be spending my time fighting for resources internally rather than building the business.\n\nI could strike out by myself and start a company... but it‚Äôll be the first time I‚Äôm doing this and I‚Äôll be starting from scratch. No money, no people, and while I understand the problem space and have some contacts, I‚Äôve never handled sales by myself, which will be crucial in getting this off the ground. A lot of this is well outside my comfort zone.\n\nAnd yet, I guess I‚Äôm curious about doing a startup? I'm feeling stagnant in my current role and looking for a new challenge. I‚Äôm compensated well enough at the moment, but little growth is likely until/unless my firm finds product market fit. Level/title progression is also unlikely, given the size of the firm, and I don‚Äôt have any equity.\n\nI think I‚Äôve found a real problem that I am equipped to address, and while there certainly will be risk, I don‚Äôt want the potential rewards diluted.\n\nSo with all of that, I‚Äôm turning to this subreddit for prerspective. What would you do in my shoes - start your own company or build a new business unit? Anyone here has done one or the other, and what was the result?\n\nThanks!\n\nTLDR, if you have a validated idea/problem, would you start a company or try to do it as a new business unit in your current company?",

Even if it was \"having a drink at the bar after work\", it\\'s still problematic. \\n\\nIf you do create a startup and get any sort of traction, they will sue the ever living shit out of you and make a very good argument that the company and IP are theirs.\\n\\nYou are in a heavily regulated industry, so again the odds are pretty good that your email is vaulted and probably your web activity as well.  I\\'d be willing to bet that you used company resources (ie your work computer or cell phone) in development of the idea... some research (google searches even), sent an email about it or asking about pain points, etc.  All of this will be evidence in their lawsuit.\\n\\nThe way to go about doing this kinda thing would have been to quit, hope that your history is clean, then goto your ceo/founder and give him a couple percentage points to be an advisor.  That would have HELPED shield your new company from a lawsuit since he is a participant (and would try to avoid having his company sue, if able) and given you access to his financial resources and connections.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nLets say your lawyer says your safe and clean. You do quit and do the startup.\\n\\nThe moment you get any traction, your old company will do it itself, sue you anyway because of\\n\\n&gt; especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse\\n\\n\"Why work with startup, llc? They stole the IP and we are suing them, work with us instead and you don\\'t need to worry about liability\".', \"No equity? Then that's a regret waiting to happen.  \\n  \\nMost likely scenario: give them the idea, execute on it and then get replaced by someone else that takes over the business unit and get all the recognition\\n\\nIf you fail, you at least learn the lessons and get some recognition. If they succeed, you probably won't get even the recognition. It's their company, they did it.\\n\\nIf they didn't find product market fit until now, they probably won't with your idea either. Execution is everything. If you can execute, it's better to do it for you.\", 'You gotta understand that these people play hard-ball.  Especially in fintech.\\n\\nBehind their smiles and demeanor, they are not going to play nice, and you should not expect them to.  \\n\\nThey want to benefit from your idea and your hard work. They want you to run a startup inside their company, but structure it so you can be removed later, if it makes money.\\n\\nThis is why late capitalism is so brutal. Our society is structured legally and culturally to reward the rich and keep people like you from striking it out on our own.\\n\\nI would create an LLC and develop an offering on the side.  I would then stockpile $ and then quit your job when your ready.  I would maintain a low profile until you are making money, then I would return to your former employer and ask if they want to buy your firm.\\n\\nBasically, you never engage with your employer until you have some leverage.', \"Suggest you try to cinch an internal deal, where you run it and get some skin in the game, or leave and do it, understanding that depending on what docs you signed when onboarded, they may have a some claim to what you do with proprietary knowledge vs. generally understood knowledge anyone would possess. However, to my mind if you succeed and they're still around to chase you, negotiate something. It'll be better that what you get if they won't deal now. Nobody wants to litigate in grey areas without deep pockets.\", 'Really depends on a) how much you believe in the idea and b) whether you are happy with the salary aspect of your current job ...', \"I'm actually in a similar situation.  I approached the leadership at the startup I work for with an idea to address an underserved niche in our larger industry, and honestly I would've been happy with allowing them to do it and consulting on the project because I'm one that never saw themselves as an entrepreneur.\\n\\nThey let me know they saw the value in the idea but couldn't execute it without additional external investment.  So I'm doing it myself (bootstrapping), and they're supportive with regard to advice and some minor marketing assistance.  The business models are related but different enough to where they are not directly competitive, but more complimentary.\\n\\nDo you really have the drive to do all of this yourself?  Sure the reward would be immense if successful but do you have the ability to see this through over the next 5 years minimum?  Do you have kids, a wife, family?  Those are considerations as well. I don't have any of those things so a lot easier for me to take this one.  \\n\\nI can't fully explain my motivations other than that I feel an impetus to make this happen that's only grown over time, somewhat fueled by the fact that my current employer has gone through several rounds of layoffs in the past 3 years.\\n\\nIf the startup I work for now were as stable or growing as they were 5 years ago I don't know if I would have the drive to get this venture going myself.  So for me, there's a mix of survival instinct combined with what I see as a viable business idea.  I would just do some self-reflection on your own motivations and you'll figure out what you need to do.\", 'If you developed the idea while working there and using company resources/information/customers, they probably already own it by virtue of your employment agreement. Do not dismiss this concern without discussing this issue with attorney conversion in the laws in your jurisdiction. There is a scenario here where you quit, start your own company, find success, and then your former employer comes back and sues you for equity or ownership of the business. This is not farfetched, though if you truly won‚Äôt be using anything you developed on company time, you may be safe and/or protected by law. Again, please consult an attorney first.\\n\\nIt sounds like you have a good relationship with the CEO, which is interesting in part because they haven‚Äôt given you equity. Ithe relationship mutual? or one-way extraction of value?\\n\\nA thing you could try to do is negotiate with them to spin the new business idea out into venture that is partly owned by your existing company and partly owned by you. In this scenario, they would contribute any IP developed inside the company, and release any claims against intellectual property theft and that sort of thing. I am skeptical that you will be able to get majority control in this situation given the history, but the idea would be to then go raise outside money from proper investors, set up a board, and all of that, so that in theory the equity interest of the former company are protected by those governance mechanisms, and so are you, at least to the extent you keep your job and have your own employment agreement.\\xa0\\n\\nI suppose you could also test the waters by simply saying to the CEO that you were thinking of quitting to try to start this on your own, and see what they say. If they threaten to sue you, then you‚Äôll know how they really feel about it. If they work to figure out how to stay involved that could lead to a healthy negotiation.\\n\\nYou could certainly try building this internally and maybe negotiating for some sort of outcome-based compensation that you can bake into your employment agreement. It seems like there is a high risk of your creating a lot of value but participating minimally in the upside in this scenario. The company point of view here is that you were paid fairly, and it is your job to create new products and lines of business for the company, so what is the problem? Your counter narrative to that is that this effort goes above and beyond and ordinary, product launch and will require much more work, dedicated resources, vision, and patience to pay off, lending itself well to being a separate entity, rather than competing for oxygen with the mature business, as you pointed out. Going down this path obviously has a high risk of failure for that reason as well\\xa0']"

         "This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific \"How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace ‚Äî Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More\" article (link to the original in the comments):\n\n# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)\n\n# Choosing the Right Idea\n\n* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.\n   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.\n   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.\n* **Don‚Äôt**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.\n   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.\n\n# Acquiring Early Customers\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:\n      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.\n      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.\n   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:\n      * Example: DoorDash‚Äôs founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.\n   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:\n      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:\n      * Example: Grubhub‚Äôs early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.\n   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:\n      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.\n\n# Retaining Customers\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:\n      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).\n      2. **‚ÄúAha‚Äù Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).\n      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).\n   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:\n      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.\n   * Ignore supply-side quality:\n      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.\n\n# Expanding the Customer Base\n\n* **Do**:\n   * **Raise supply standards over time**:\n      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb‚Äôs Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).\n      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace‚Äôs reputation.\n   * **Adapt your value proposition**:\n      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.\n   * **Grow with your customers**:\n      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.\n      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:\n      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.\n\n# Scaling Up\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Invest in **data sophistication**:\n      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).\n      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.\n   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:\n      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.\n   * Be a **fast follower**:\n      * Rapidly adapt to competitors‚Äô successful innovations.\n      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace‚Äôs liquidity.\n   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).\n\n# General Strategies for Marketplaces\n\n* **Liquidity is Key**:\n   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.\n* **Trust is Foundational**:\n   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.\n* **Iterate Based on Data**:\n   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.\n\n# Case Studies and Insights\n\n1. **Grubhub**:\n   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.\n2. **Faire**:\n   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.\n3. **Eventbrite**:\n   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.\n4. **Whatnot**:\n   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.\n\n# Key Foundational Mindsets\n\n* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.\n* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.\n* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.\n* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.\n\n",

         "I've been thinking about an idea and wanted to get some feedback on its feasibility and whether it might have any real business demand. The concept involves using AI to personalize songs by replacing part or all of the lyrics while preserving the original artist's unique vocal style.\n\nThe idea is to uses AI to change lyrics in a song while keeping the original artist's unique voice and style. For example, if there‚Äôs a song where the artist sings someone‚Äôs name, this system could swap that name out for a different one, and it‚Äôll still sound like the same artist singing it, with the same tone, style, and emotion. This could be used in music streaming platforms to create personalized song, or in apps like TikTok to generate custom audio tracks for user-generated content.\n\nHow It Works:\nThe AI is trained using recordings of the artist‚Äôs voice, along with the musical scores and lyrics (or phonemes). This helps the system learn how the artist sings‚Äîlike their tone, pitch, and timing.\nWhen it‚Äôs time to make changes, the program takes the original song, separates the voice from the instruments, and identifies the part of the vocal line to change. Then, using the new lyrics and pitch details from the original song, it generates a new vocal segment that sounds just like the artist. This new piece is added back to the song, replacing the old section.\n\nExample Use Case:\nImagine a song where the artist sings, ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Sarah.‚Äù With this system, you could change \"Sarah\" to another name, like \"David,\" and it would still sound like the same artist singing it. The rest of the song stays untouched‚Äîsame voice, same style, same everything‚Äîjust a new name in the lyrics.\n\nIt could also be used to:\n\nLocalize songs into different languages while keeping the artist's original singing style.\n\nCreate clean versions of songs by swapping out explicit lyrics.\n\nThis is an easy way to personalize or adapt music without needing the artist to re-record anything.\n\nThis process can currently be achieved through methods like recording a new version of the song with the desired lyrics and then use voice conversion, or through extensive audio editing and manual adjustments. However, my goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient approach that automates this process using AI, making it faster and more accessible while maintaining the quality and authenticity of the original performance.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear thoughts on whether this idea seems technically viable and if there‚Äôs a market for such a feature in the music or entertainment industries. Feedback and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

So, I‚Äôm putting myself out there in the hope that someone here might resonate with my journey or know someone who does.*\n\nI‚Äôve spent the past few years building and scaling a successful agency specializing in SEO and digital marketing.\n\nIt‚Äôs been an incredible journey, and we‚Äôve helped numerous clients achieve significant growth. But now, I‚Äôm ready to take on a new challenge: building a product.\n\nWhile I won‚Äôt go into specifics about the product here, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been deeply passionate about, and I believe it has the potential to solve a real problem for a large audience. With my background in SEO and growth marketing, I‚Äôm confident in our ability to create and scale this product effectively.\n\nAs a bootstrap founder, I understand the value of money and how to manage it effectively. Every rupee in my agency was reinvested strategically to drive growth, and that same discipline will guide me as I build and scale this product.\n\n**My biggest constraint right now? Finding warm introductions to VCs. Having operated in the bootstrap world, I know how essential the right connections are, and I‚Äôm looking for investors who value founders with operational experience and a proven track record in execution.**\n\n**If you know someone who might be interested or can point me in the right direction, I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful.**\n\nFeel free to DM me or comment here if you‚Äôre open to connecting or sharing advice‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to chat.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

         "Quickly estimating the value of your startup equity",
         "Please, please, please... make sure you understand the potential value of your equity, whether you're currently employed at a startup or evaluating an offer letter. Here's a quick way to estimate your equity:\n\n1. **Estimate acquisition price (ARR x exit multiples)**\n   * Look up industry multiples. For B2B SaaS companies, typical exit multiples might be:\n      * Low end: 5√ó ARR\n      * Average: 10√ó ARR\n      * Good: 15√ó ARR\n      * Best-in-class: 20‚Äì25√ó ARR (often through strategic acquisitions)\n2. **Make an acquisition fee assumption**\n   * Assume 10% in fees. This covers costs like investment banking, due diligence, legal, and consulting fees. So, 10% will come off the top of the acquisition price\n3. **Look up equity capital raised**\n   * Equity capital raised is typically preferred equity, which gets paid back at sale to preferred shareholders (investors) before common shareholders see proceeds. This can be typically found online on Crunchbase or by adding up all the funding rounds\n4. **Determine your equity ownership**\n   * Divide your shares by the total fully diluted shares outstanding. Note: You likely do not have direct access to the cap table, but it is appropriate to ask for the # of shares outstanding when receiving an offer. If your a current employee, ask someone with access.\n5. **Calculate your cost to exercise**\n   * Multiply your shares by your strike price(s). This is what you'll pay to exercise your stock options. Note: I wont be discussing this in the post, but be mindful of AMT tax implications on the delta between the FMV and strike\n6. **Determine net gain or loss on equity**\n   * Equity value = (((Acquisition Price √ó (1 - Acquisition Fee %)) - Capital Raised) √ó Your Ownership %) - Cost to Exercise\n\n**Let's take a look at an example for B2B SaaS**\n\nDetails\n\n* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $20 million\n* Potential Exit Multiples: 5√ó, 10√ó, and 15√ó ARR\n* Acquisition Fees: 10% of acquisition price\n* Capital Raised: $80 million\n* Total Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted): 40 million shares\n* Your Shares: 175,000 shares\n* Your Ownership Percentage: 175,000 / 40,000,000 =0 .4375%\n* Strike Price per Share: $1.25\n* Cost to Exercise: 175,000¬†shares √ó $1.25 = $218,750\n\nCalculation (for 10x multiple estimate)\n\n* Company purchase price: $20m \\* 10m\n* Proceeds after fees: $200m √ó (1‚àí0.10) = $180m\n* Proceeds after paying back investors: $180m ‚àí$80m = $100m\n* Value of your equity: $100m √ó 0.4375% = $437.5k\n* Net gain/loss on equity (adjusted for exercise cost) = $437.5k ‚àí $218.75k = $218.75k\n\nNet gain or loss on equity\n\n|100m (5x ARR)|200m (10x ARR)|300m (15x ARR)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\-$175k|$218.75k|$612.5k|\n\nYes, you read that right, the employee actually lost money at the $100m exit, due to the capital raised and the cost to exercise exceeding your share of the proceeds. There are 100s of other variables that could influence your exit potential; that being said, this is a good general framework for getting a ballpark idea.",

Is it even important?\n\nI would like to provide a product/service (not just training) that integrates an Operations mind into a company's day-to-day and long term goals.¬†\n\nThe way I see this now is a remote team that assists on a weekly basis by providing groundwork and a road map.

(Paid ads, organic search, word of mouth, etc.?)\n\nI've been developing a platform that connects homeowners with local home improvement professionals (to put it in simple terms.) While running Google Ads campaigns generates good engagement from homeowners (demand side), my organic search traffic is nearly nonexistent - probably because of the SEO issues that I'm currently fixing.\n\nThe problem is that this paid acquisition strategy isn't sustainable yet, since I don't have enough professionals (supply side) on the platform. I'm charging professionals for leads, but without sufficient demand, it's hard to demonstrate value to professionals and convince them to join the platform.\n\nI understand the theory of subsidizing one side of a marketplace to attract the other, but in practice, it feels like I'll have to subsidize both sides until reaching critical mass - if that's even achievable.\n\nFor those who've faced similar challenges: What strategies worked for your platform to overcome this chicken-and-egg problem?",

We officially opened for business on the day I started my job. \n\nMy complaints consist of: me not having an official title, my bosses unwillingness to become any sort of organized, all of our work having to come through me 1st due to my boss not wanting to pay for anyone else to have access to our software, I feel like often ppl are just waiting around on me because i'm crammed full of tasks that are more important than things like providing a cross reference part number for inventory, communication is never consistent, my boss likes to tell people important things verbally, he will randomly send an email or text, but it's never over one platform for easier documentation, he'll verbally tell our team something important that needs to get done, but because he's so overwhelmed with so many things, or won't get off of his phone to focus because he wants to be on call 24/7 for customers, it's completely incorrect information resulting in everyone else working harder &amp; unproductively on unimportant tasks, he consistently questions everything i'm doing as if he doesn't trust me, recently I needed to share something to our company drop-box &amp; I didn't have the admin permission to do it, not only did he deny me admin access to complete this task, but he also refused to attempt to add the documentations to the drop-box that I was unable to, these are just examples of things that happen often, unfortunately. \n\nMy responsibilities are:\n\nCreate PO's for Vendors, Create Jobs in our system for customers, print packing lists, receive packages in the system, create invoices for customers, input &amp; pay invoices for vendors. Keep products stocked, pull orders, maintain correct inventory in system, book freight pickup, answer phone calls, send order confirmations, ect. I wear just about every hat possible here.\n\n  \nI guess, I just want to know if this is normal &amp; should I expect it to get better? \n\nThere's no denying that we've been successful. My boss is amazing at sales. We're on the verge of being booked &amp; busy for the next 2 years. However, I feel like i'm fighting an uphill battle because the way my boss sees it is, he knew how to do everything &amp; was able to function \"fine\", so why should it change? None of our team can function this way. We're trying to improve now, but it's hard when resources are limited &amp; our boss complains about things like us organizing inventory, or pushes back on every single thing. It was a fight just to get inventory shelves. \n\nI feel if I was compensated more, it may all be worth it. But as of right now, i'm making $18 an hour with no benefits other than a week of sick time. Even if I needed insurance I wouldn't be able to afford it after bills. I just feel like it's not fair when i'm writing checks for my manager &amp; his business partner that are sometimes $25k in 2 months. \n\n  \nMaybe i'm a whiner &amp; not meant for this kind of work? But I feel there is an awful lot being asked of me for a paycheck that I could make working at a gas station doing mindless labor. I just thought it would've gotten better by now.",

         "['I think you need to ask yourself whether you‚Äôre learning the right stuff for the direction that you want to head in. What attracted you to working at a startup in the first place? \\n\\nThere is a very big difference between what you‚Äôre doing and working at a gas station from a learning perspective right? It sounds to me like you‚Äôre essentially a key administrator in the company. How much time do you spend talking to customers? Are you in any meetings where deals are being negotiated? Are you involved in figuring out pricing? Do you help with hiring? All of these things, including the admin and orchestration you are doing, are training you in how to run a business. If that‚Äôs something you can see yourself doing in the future, specifically in whatever industry you‚Äôre involved in, then you‚Äôre on the right track. You‚Äôre gaining the right skills and the domain knowledge. \\n\\nIf you‚Äôre not getting the money you want and not gaining the knowledge and education you want then you definitely should leave. But yeah just don‚Äôt forget to evaluate the intangible benefits of your job.\\n\\nSlight sidetrack but about the money: More money will come when you figure out how to have more leverage. Figuring out your specific combination of skills that makes you particularly valuable. You will often find that great generalists also have one particular skill that they‚Äôre especially good at. An example in your boss‚Äô case, as you describe him, would be sales. Do you have any specific areas of expertise which can combine with your skills as a generalist? Just something to think about.\\n\\nUltimately what I‚Äôm saying is figure out where you want to be first and work backwards from there. If this current job isn‚Äôt heading you in the right direction, then leave. The advantage of a startup is that you get to see and be part of the entire process, where at a giant org you‚Äôre generally working on one small piece. If that interests you then stick to it. If you want a prescribed track for growth and mentorship etc then you might be better off in a bigger company.', 'Your role is an admin/operations for a small company.   If $18/hr is what admins in your area get then you‚Äôre paid about right.   If you think you are much more than an admin, apparently your boss does not.    None of the functions you describe are strategic and you can be replaced pretty easily.\\n\\nIf it really bugs you, go send out some resumes and when you find a $25/hr job that sounds really rewarding to your future, then quit.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre boss really likes you he can pay you more to not quit and you can negotiate a title, otherwise enjoy you new job.', 'You type too much to work at a startup. Seriously the whiney energy is too strong here. Go back to corporate, you will be happier.', \"Here's what I suggest you do: \\n\\n- fix your punctuation, a grown shouldn't be writing like that \\n- quit and ask to go back to your old job, you'd be surprised at how many people do U-turns back to old employers\", \"You need to be a good organizer.\\n\\nHire one more person to help you.\\n\\nSomeone should aauze boss instructions and take action only after making sure it's right. That could be you. But it needs to be an acquired skill. So work on that.\\n\\nAre you bored or interested I  this work and mainly are you excelling in it . Are you learning.  If yes good. If not then it's a problem.  Do you feel you have the right skills for the job.\\n\\nDo you have equity . If no then you are am employee and must make more monies\", 'Startups are chaos. It is sort of just the way it is, operationally.\\n\\nThe character of your leader will come into play a LOT as you grow. Scaling is hard, and working at a startup is hard - you want a leader that 1) understands and respects the pressure on the people below them, and 2) is willing to grow and change - because as the organization changes, they have to change, or everyone will leave/the org will die.\\n\\nIt sounds like they may be resistant to change, but they may also just not want to share their struggle with you - fine. But keep an eye out for this. If they\\'re not growing and adjusting, tough road ahead. Also - are they taking a good paycheck while you\\'re not? If so, warning sign. They ought to be the last one to be paid well (IMO, a founder), because they own most of the company and should be putting their people first because they know that, without you, things won\\'t work.\\n\\nYou\\'re not a \"whiner,\" there\\'s no shame in wanting something better if this sucks.', '**Options** \\n\\n* Quit \\n* Ask for more money. \\n* Ask for help \\n* Steal money \\n* Shut up and take it']"

         "Hi everyone! I'm currently researching how early-stage startups keep up with the endless stream of opportunities like grants, accelerators, and hackathons that pop up throughout the year. From what I've gathered, it seems like many founders feel overwhelmed or worry about missing deadlines for key applications.\n\nFor those of you who have been in this situation, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences:\n\n* **How do you currently find and track these kinds of events?** (specific tools, websites, or communities you rely on)\n* **Do you ever feel like you miss out on important opportunities because of timing or lack of information?**\n* **If there were a way to receive regular alerts or updates tailored to your startup‚Äôs stage or sector, would that be helpful?**\n\nP.S: here is the feedback that I already got from some of my friends (from India):  \n1. Hire interns explicitly for this job - they keep searching for the relevant info on the internet and share that with the management.  \n2. Have a calendar of events and look for that.  \n3. Get information from incubators and WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram groups\n\nEven if your current method is same, please let me know.\n\nAny insights you share would be really valuable for understanding this space better, and I think it could help a lot of us brainstorm better ways to streamline the discovery process.

         "CTO or founding engineer US -&gt; EU -- am I wildly off-base?",
         "I am a PhD MBA candidate at a top university in aerospace graduating spring 2025 with an offer for $230k/y sal + $70k/yr equity with SpaceX or $275k at a defense tech growth-stage startup with some equity I'm not sure.\n\nI've recently been contacted by an EU foreign national to build X product to help Ukraine, something I certainly believe in. This is my bread-and-butter, unlike SpaceX (but the other company is similar). He mentioned in his first email that he was looking for a founding controls engineer, but when he saw my background he decided he was **considering co-founder**. He has great credentials\n\nHe says **he put in $250k** and has a product that looks good, and I think his idea is very good--I believe in the idea, but has significant amounts of technical debt. **He says his traction is a LOI** with the Ukrainian military and soldiers who want the device. I do not believe he can close the design and get the product to do all of X correctly by himself (probably can get it to do half of X), he's currently using hobby components, but he knows he will have to get serious about those things in the future. **He says he plans to raise $1.5 mil VC but no specific timeline or valuation**. On his slides, he says 50% of that will be for salaries. He does not seem to be working on the product, he mainly seems to be evaluating sites to build production later on, the complex physical product doesn't seem to have changed much in 6 months, but part of the software is getting better.\n\nWe spoke briefly and I passed a long series of technical checks with people he trusts, including people who build products similar to his. He threw out an offer of **15% + CTO + unspecified salary + move to UK or eastern Europe**, and we kind of mutually talked about about being lean as a founder on salary when you believe in the mission. It was kind of a spur of the moment \"gut check\" thing his father told him to do. I thanked him for the offer, told him I would consider it, and spoke with founders and staff here at my college to understand the offer and decide if it's worth it.\n\nBasically everyone I talked to said that what should be worth it for me would be 25%-30% + CTO + salary at 60% of my market rate. I decided, I guess for no reason, but to be nice to my potential founder and shot for 25% + CTO + cost of living + 60k salary, or an offer that was 25% + CTO + salary of 50% market or $150k. (I gave the COL offer because he's deciding whether or not to place the HQ in the UK or eastern European nations). I told him that basically, you know, founding a company is about trust and candor, so that's what I was thinking but I was very open to talking about it and seeing if we can reach a compromise. I basically targeted 25% 150k because **I was fine with 25% + $120k post-negotiation salary** or even lower but we would have to get into pro-forma to justify.\n\nI personally feel this is really fair for a \"gut check\" move across the world to join a startup with no complete product, no sales, and no raised funds besides his initial $250k. Equity-wise, I'm probably going to be deflated by the time we launch the first product, and there's so many market risks with the war in Ukraine.\n\nNot so to the potential cofounder. He said he and his other employee, someone on at \\~5%, are taking salaries of only $30k and he says that I have to weigh the mission--which I believe in--vs the better compensation of SpaceX, and he won't be able to get near SpaceX. He also mentioned he is reconsidering me for the CTO role because he's more worried about manufacture (downshift to founding engineer). He wants me to be involved with his team at a **low salary of $30k and no stated equity to see how we work together** (?) before making a vesting schedule and actually agreeing on equity.\n\nI basically told him that I wouldn't quit my PhD/MBA for that, nor move. You know, am I crazy? He is aware of cliffs and vesting, why doesn't he do that? I feel like, if we're successful, he's going to make a chunk of change, I'm going to make a little, and it's going to be very worth it for him, not so worth it for me.\n\nI basically said a CTO is a powerhouse all-star that can build the product without you in the loop if needed, e.g. when fundraising, and if I can't do that he fires me. Is that just America? Are the salaries that crazy different that $30k @ 15% is reasonable for a CTO to move across the world? I understand he put $250k in, but if I'm not getting any of it, why am I not at like 40-45%?\n\nTL;DR: Foreign co-founder has a half-product that I (PhD/MBA) can close, and wants me to move to his location and develop a product at 15% equity, $30k salary, when I have a great SpaceX offer. I like the startup space more and am highly motivated about the mission.",

That way you can see what working together is like and if it's something you want to do long term.\\n\\nThat said, his comp of $30k is crazy low. Maybe if he commits to pay raises pending his next round. Your offer of 22%/120k is super fair from a negotiation standpoint IMHO, especially given your other offer(s). OTOH 120k is half of their 250k resources, which is unfair to him. The 15% initial offer seems like a low-ball, though.\\n\\nSalaries are definitely lower in the EU in general\\n\\nA LOI is normally nothing - fairy dust. Nice to look at but has no substance. B2G is normally brutal due to the glacial pace that governments work at and all their procurement rules/processes. Ukraine/military is probably the one exception to that right now, since they're getting killed and would rather throw money/tech at their problems than bodies/lives. So that might actually be the best possible LOI to have in the world now. However, as another poster mentioned, it has an unknown expiry date if/when they lose.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that the business wouldn't stop at Ukraine, you'd use that as a stepping stone to sell to other countries. Some people have ethical concerns about working in the military industry.\\n\\nAre you crazy to leave the Space X and growth-stage offers? Yeah, obviously. But if you really want to follow your heart and do something crazy, there's room to finesse the negotiations and work something out that isn't a scam for either of you. I'd say define the trial period of work (probably time based, like the first semester of 2025 so you can go back to school if it's a no) and what deliverables you expect to get done (transitioning from prototype to final design, whatever else).\\n\\nThen consider what happens next - if you both say yes and you join as a co-founder, what's the salary and comp. His current offer is too low on both. Push him a bit to work on and seal his round. If he can say 'hot shot PHD under contract will be joining as CTO,' that's a good indicator to investors.\\n\\nIf he says no, he's basically firing you, so you should get some severance or additional compensation if he ends up selling your design/work. I'd think about a royalty, % up to a total sales value that might be acheivable in the first year or two. e.g. 5%, up to a max of 100k from the first $2 million in sales.

         "**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôd do differently‚Ä¶**\n\n**Document your journey.**\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you‚Äôre working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.\n\n**Here‚Äôs why it matters:**\n\n* **It motivates you.** When you‚Äôre deep in the grind, it‚Äôs easy to forget how far you‚Äôve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you‚Äôve achieved.\n* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.\n\n**My biggest regret:**  \nI‚Äôve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I‚Äôve made, but I wish I had captured more.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I‚Äôve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It‚Äôs one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.\n\n**If you‚Äôre just starting out:**\n\n* Be proud of what you‚Äôre doing.\n* Share your wins and your challenges.\n* If you‚Äôre not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.\n\nI used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I‚Äôve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.\n\n**Don‚Äôt wait. Start documenting today, even if it‚Äôs just for yourself, you‚Äôll thank yourself later.**",

         "Hey guys,\n\nMy co founders and I just launched our MVP platform a couple weeks ago which acts like a job aggregator for healthcare clinicians for specific jobs that are starting to be offered by hospitals right now. The current/traditional way of finding these is through a staffing agency but that means less pay for clinicians and more premium costs for employers. Our goal is to make that connection directly without the need for a middle-man.\n\nWe wouldnt get one type of user without the other so we scraped a bunch of these jobs for clinicians to view and request to apply to for free and got a little bit of traction but were struggling to get traction and in touch with the right people on the hospital side to work with us or at least provide some feedback. We know for a 100% fact they would benefit from this product though from past jobs but if it takes too long we dont want it to jeopardize our current users.\n\nAnyone have any tips for navigating the traditional \"which comes first, chicken or the egg\" scenario for a startup? We really want to try to focus on one to hopefully make it easier to get the other.\n\nthanks!",

Nothing worse for team motivation than flailing against someone who is convinced they‚Äôve found your Achilles heel.', \"One time I was in a VC pitch meeting as the technical cofounder. My two cofounders were smooth ex-MBA types. It was during COVID, so everything was remote. Oversized clothes were starting to trend, and I was wearing some baggy pants.\\n\\nMid-pitch, I stood up to adjust my camera, and my pants fell straight to my ankles.

Whether it is a VC, accelerator, or anything. One needs to be confident that they are entering into \"partnership\" where both the parties stakes are important. One needs to definitely do the homework about knowing the VC. I understand we want to talk to anyone when funds are drying fast but we just have to be prepared for any outcome. Fund raising is not for everyone.', 'What went wrong? Have you considered what you can learn from it? Maybe nothing, but probably something. If you have a great idea and are fortunate only 1 in 50+ meetings will go exceptionally well and maybe lead to funding, so mourn for a bit and them move on to what comes next. But first reflect on what you could have done differently.', \"Funny story for you.\\n\\nA few years ago, I pitched for an event hosted by one of the top tech companies (their VC arm). This event was extremely public and mega hyped on LinkedIn. We were in the middle of a fundraise with most of it committed at that point. \\n\\nWe had to compete against a YC company. When we practiced our pitch the day before, they listened to our pitch and copied a bunch of my content. ü§°\\n\\nWe ended up losing to a YC company that literally stole our pitch deck, had 0 revenue or traction whatsoever, but they were YC and none of the other competitors were ü•¥. Keep in mind my team was revenue generating (over 1M) with the team to back it. \\n\\nWell, other VC's were at this competition, a bunch pulled out from my round to explore other opportunities with said YC company. I'll never know if they invested or not. \\n\\nMy entire round lost traction because of that stupid competition. One by one every opportunity fell. It was a complete sh*show. \\n\\nThey've picked a YC company every year, I honestly just should've known better. Props to the company that snaked me, that takes skill. I am incredibly jaded towards the industry now and I am definitely not the same person as I was before that pitch. It changes you. \\n\\nAll in, don't sweat one convo, VC's aren't worth stressing over. Bootstrap as much as you can and keep your equity because when you really need your VC's - they won't be there for you.\", 'During my first startup, we had a partner pitch meeting setup via Zoom( during COVID). The partner turned off her camera during my pitch saying something about her connection being bad.  A few minutes into my pitch she actually started a phone call.  I know because  I could hear her. The principal on the call kept telling her that we could hear her and I could also hear him frantically typing- I assuming messaging her -to turn off her mic. She later apologized that it was an LP that called and that she had to take the call. I wanted just hang up- maybe I should have- but I shrugged it off till the end. I‚Äôm on startup #2 and her firm is on my list of investors to avoid.', 'honestly most of my friends have had very toxic experiences with VC interviews where they just drill you on metrics &amp; say a bunch of negative things about how you\\'re going to fail and so many people are building the \"exact same thing as you\" &amp; try to tear you apart so they can lowball a cap or valuation -- but then the moment you show that other VCs are interested, they suddenly change and are so excited and positive and say that the problems they identified previously surely aren\\'t issues. i hope you feel better soon but also remember it\\'s a two way street!', 'This is why I boot strap. I couldn‚Äôt handle being poked and made to be stupid.', 'I have a story for you. I went to an accelerator pitch absolutely hungover many years ago. The worst hangover I‚Äôve ever had. I barely spoke and the managing director basically passed during the meeting and leveraged the situation to offer me the worst terms I‚Äôve ever read in my life (I get nothing, they get everything basically). I passed on the deal and had a lot of shame for a while. I thought I was done. I kept working and I ended up getting in another, much better accelerator and got one of the best terms. I was very young (20 iirc) and very dumb. Shit happens, there are many VCs out there. Don‚Äôt think about it too much.

Good luck my man.', 'had a talk with a vc, young woman i met at a conference seemed pretty cool and interested. during our interview she asked questions about our tech and one small part is blockchain, at this time we mentioned that. she asked such stupid questions about blockchain in general as she never fully understood its principals etc. she had totally wrong opinions and my colleagues and I sat there in the meeting totally flabbergasted. she didn‚Äôt seem to care anymore about our startup. she was so on the blockchain hate train. we abonded from this day on to ever mention blockchain. she rejected our startup as she thought the blockchain part was it‚Äôs ruining part. we thought that she was an uneducated person and her position at this esteemed vc made me think that she was a personality or gender hire‚Ä¶..', \"Pitching VC's is like going on dates.

I declined repeatedly -- but then ended up losing my voice and needing water in the middle of the pitch\\n* many firms simply ghosted me after meetings that I thought went reasonably well.  my favorites were the ones that ghosted me but added me to their email newsletter lists\\n* VC's who sent me rejection emails even after I was careful to establish up front that I was having an exploratory conversation for a potential future round, not actually fundraising\\n* (this might be my favorite) the second-tier VC's (a number of years ago now) who told me how focused they were on iOS apps -- and promptly pulled their blackberries out during the meeting\", \"VCs are for the most part a joke.

         "Hi folks, looking some perspective here. I have been working on validating a problem for a while now and I am at the point where I want to seriously work on it.\n\nMy day job is running product at a fintech firm, and I am somewhat close to the Founder/CEO. So I approached him about the idea, somewhat naively hoping that I could fish out some pre-seed money. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything really, but figured no harm in asking.\n\nTurns out the CEO is quite interested, but wants to develop it as a new business division. I suppose hindsight, this should have been an obvious potential outcomes.\n\nWhat‚Äôs makes the proposal sensible is that my current firm operates in the same industry, practically serving the same clients albeit on different solutions. Working within the firm would give me access to resources - a technology team to build the product, sales people who are very well connected within the industry, and firm has big-name investors, which could open doors, especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse.\n\nBut, where there is trepidation: my firm is currently stretched across multiple products, and is still searching for product market fit. I‚Äôm afraid that by attaching my idea to a company that is already struggling at prioritizing and gaining traction, I will be spending my time fighting for resources internally rather than building the business.\n\nI could strike out by myself and start a company... but it‚Äôll be the first time I‚Äôm doing this and I‚Äôll be starting from scratch. No money, no people, and while I understand the problem space and have some contacts, I‚Äôve never handled sales by myself, which will be crucial in getting this off the ground. A lot of this is well outside my comfort zone.\n\nAnd yet, I guess I‚Äôm curious about doing a startup? I'm feeling stagnant in my current role and looking for a new challenge. I‚Äôm compensated well enough at the moment, but little growth is likely until/unless my firm finds product market fit.

What would you do in my shoes - start your own company or build a new business unit? Anyone here has done one or the other, and what was the result?\n\nThanks!\n\nTLDR, if you have a validated idea/problem, would you start a company or try to do it as a new business unit in your current company?",
         "['&gt; figured no harm in asking.\\n\\n&gt; proposal sensible is that my current firm operates in the same industry, practically serving the same clients\\n\\nWell man, odds are you are kinda fucked.\\n\\nYour best option is business unit, but you can try to negotiate some sort of agreement with the \"friendly\" CEO/Founder and get it in writing.  Increased comp, options, grants, some equity in the case of a spin off, whatever.\\n\\nIf you want to do a startup, your first stop before even registering an LLC is to get your current contracts together and go find a decent employment lawyer and detail everything to them.\\n\\nOdds are pretty good your contract has work product/idea clauses and you\\'ve more then likely triggered them with your conversation with the CEO.  On top of non-compete, no poaching, or other clauses you are going to run into.\\n\\nYou had a conversation about an idea you had in the same industry with your employer.  Reading between the lines, you even did it during working hours.  Even if it was \"having a drink at the bar after work\", it\\'s still problematic. \\n\\nIf you do create a startup and get any sort of traction, they will sue the ever living shit out of you and make a very good argument that the company and IP are theirs.\\n\\nYou are in a heavily regulated industry, so again the odds are pretty good that your email is vaulted and probably your web activity as well.  I\\'d be willing to bet that you used company resources (ie your work computer or cell phone) in development of the idea... some research (google searches even), sent an email about it or asking about pain points, etc.  All of this will be evidence in their lawsuit.\\n\\nThe way to go about doing this kinda thing would have been to quit, hope that your history is clean, then goto your ceo/founder and give him a couple percentage points to be an advisor.  That would have HELPED shield your new company from a lawsuit since he is a participant (and would try to avoid having his company sue, if able) and given you access to his financial resources and connections.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nLets say your lawyer says your safe and clean. You do quit and do the startup.\\n\\nThe moment you get any traction, your old company will do it itself, sue you anyway because of\\n\\n&gt; especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse\\n\\n\"Why work with startup, llc?

If they succeed, you probably won't get even the recognition. It's their company, they did it.\\n\\nIf they didn't find product market fit until now, they probably won't with your idea either. Execution is everything. If you can execute, it's better to do it for you.\", 'You gotta understand that these people play hard-ball.  Especially in fintech.\\n\\nBehind their smiles and demeanor, they are not going to play nice, and you should not expect them to.  \\n\\nThey want to benefit from your idea and your hard work. They want you to run a startup inside their company, but structure it so you can be removed later, if it makes money.\\n\\nThis is why late capitalism is so brutal. Our society is structured legally and culturally to reward the rich and keep people like you from striking it out on our own.\\n\\nI would create an LLC and develop an offering on the side.  I would then stockpile $ and then quit your job when your ready.  I would maintain a low profile until you are making money, then I would return to your former employer and ask if they want to buy your firm.\\n\\nBasically, you never engage with your employer until you have some leverage.', \"Suggest you try to cinch an internal deal, where you run it and get some skin in the game, or leave and do it, understanding that depending on what docs you signed when onboarded, they may have a some claim to what you do with proprietary knowledge vs. generally understood knowledge anyone would possess. However, to my mind if you succeed and they're still around to chase you, negotiate something. It'll be better that what you get if they won't deal now. Nobody wants to litigate in grey areas without deep pockets.\", 'Really depends on a) how much you believe in the idea and b) whether you are happy with the salary aspect of your current job ...', \"I'm actually in a similar situation.  I approached the leadership at the startup I work for with an idea to address an underserved niche in our larger industry, and honestly I would've been happy with allowing them to do it and consulting on the project because I'm one that never saw themselves as an entrepreneur.\\n\\nThey let me know they saw the value in the idea but couldn't execute it without additional external investment.  So I'm doing it myself (bootstrapping), and they're supportive with regard to advice and some minor marketing assistance.  The business models are related but different enough to where they are not directly competitive, but more complimentary.\\n\\nDo you really have the drive to do all of this yourself?  Sure the reward would be immense if successful but do you have the ability to see this through over the next 5 years minimum?  Do you have kids, a wife, family?  Those are considerations as well. I don't have any of those things so a lot easier for me to take this one.  \\n\\nI can't fully explain my motivations other than that I feel an impetus to make this happen that's only grown over time, somewhat fueled by the fact that my current employer has gone through several rounds of layoffs in the past 3 years.\\n\\nIf the startup I work for now were as stable or growing as they were 5 years ago I don't know if I would have the drive to get this venture going myself.  So for me, there's a mix of survival instinct combined with what I see as a viable business idea.  I would just do some self-reflection on your own motivations and you'll figure out what you need to do.\", 'If you developed the idea while working there and using company resources/information/customers, they probably already own it by virtue of your employment agreement. Do not dismiss this concern without discussing this issue with attorney conversion in the laws in your jurisdiction. There is a scenario here where you quit, start your own company, find success, and then your former employer comes back and sues you for equity or ownership of the business. This is not farfetched, though if you truly won‚Äôt be using anything you developed on company time, you may be safe and/or protected by law. Again, please consult an attorney first.\\n\\nIt sounds like you have a good relationship with the CEO, which is interesting in part because they haven‚Äôt given you equity. Ithe relationship mutual? or one-way extraction of value?\\n\\nA thing you could try to do is negotiate with them to spin the new business idea out into venture that is partly owned by your existing company and partly owned by you. In this scenario, they would contribute any IP developed inside the company, and release any claims against intellectual property theft and that sort of thing. I am skeptical that you will be able to get majority control in this situation given the history, but the idea would be to then go raise outside money from proper investors, set up a board, and all of that, so that in theory the equity interest of the former company are protected by those governance mechanisms, and so are you, at least to the extent you keep your job and have your own employment agreement.\\xa0\\n\\nI suppose you could also test the waters by simply saying to the CEO that you were thinking of quitting to try to start this on your own, and see what they say. If they threaten to sue you, then you‚Äôll know how they really feel about it. If they work to figure out how to stay involved that could lead to a healthy negotiation.\\n\\nYou could certainly try building this internally and maybe negotiating for some sort of outcome-based compensation that you can bake into your employment agreement. It seems like there is a high risk of your creating a lot of value but participating minimally in the upside in this scenario. The company point of view here is that you were paid fairly, and it is your job to create new products and lines of business for the company, so what is the problem? Your counter narrative to that is that this effort goes above and beyond and ordinary, product launch and will require much more work, dedicated resources, vision, and patience to pay off, lending itself well to being a separate entity, rather than competing for oxygen with the mature business, as you pointed out. Going down this path obviously has a high risk of failure for that reason as well\\xa0']"

         "This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific \"How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace ‚Äî Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More\" article (link to the original in the comments):\n\n# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)\n\n# Choosing the Right Idea\n\n* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.\n   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.\n   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.\n* **Don‚Äôt**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.\n   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.\n\n# Acquiring Early Customers\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:\n      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.\n      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.\n   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:\n      * Example: DoorDash‚Äôs founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.\n   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:\n      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:\n      * Example: Grubhub‚Äôs early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.\n   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:\n      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.\n\n# Retaining Customers\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:\n      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).\n      2. **‚ÄúAha‚Äù Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).\n      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).\n   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:\n      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.\n   * Ignore supply-side quality:\n      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.\n\n# Expanding the Customer Base\n\n* **Do**:\n   * **Raise supply standards over time**:\n      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb‚Äôs Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).\n      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace‚Äôs reputation.\n   * **Adapt your value proposition**:\n      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.\n   * **Grow with your customers**:\n      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.\n      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:\n      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.\n\n# Scaling Up\n\n* **Do**:\n   * Invest in **data sophistication**:\n      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).\n      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.\n   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:\n      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.\n   * Be a **fast follower**:\n      * Rapidly adapt to competitors‚Äô successful innovations.\n      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.\n* **Don‚Äôt**:\n   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace‚Äôs liquidity.\n   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).\n\n# General Strategies for Marketplaces\n\n* **Liquidity is Key**:\n   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.\n* **Trust is Foundational**:\n   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.\n* **Iterate Based on Data**:\n   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.\n\n# Case Studies and Insights\n\n1. **Grubhub**:\n   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.\n2. **Faire**:\n   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.\n3. **Eventbrite**:\n   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.\n4. **Whatnot**:\n   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.\n\n# Key Foundational Mindsets\n\n* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.\n* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.\n* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.\n* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.\n\n",

         "I've been thinking about an idea and wanted to get some feedback on its feasibility and whether it might have any real business demand. The concept involves using AI to personalize songs by replacing part or all of the lyrics while preserving the original artist's unique vocal style.\n\nThe idea is to uses AI to change lyrics in a song while keeping the original artist's unique voice and style. For example, if there‚Äôs a song where the artist sings someone‚Äôs name, this system could swap that name out for a different one, and it‚Äôll still sound like the same artist singing it, with the same tone, style, and emotion. This could be used in music streaming platforms to create personalized song, or in apps like TikTok to generate custom audio tracks for user-generated content.\n\nHow It Works:\nThe AI is trained using recordings of the artist‚Äôs voice, along with the musical scores and lyrics (or phonemes). This helps the system learn how the artist sings‚Äîlike their tone, pitch, and timing.\nWhen it‚Äôs time to make changes, the program takes the original song, separates the voice from the instruments, and identifies the part of the vocal line to change. Then, using the new lyrics and pitch details from the original song, it generates a new vocal segment that sounds just like the artist. This new piece is added back to the song, replacing the old section.\n\nExample Use Case:\nImagine a song where the artist sings, ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Sarah.‚Äù With this system, you could change \"Sarah\" to another name, like \"David,\" and it would still sound like the same artist singing it. The rest of the song stays untouched‚Äîsame voice, same style, same everything‚Äîjust a new name in the lyrics.\n\nIt could also be used to:\n\nLocalize songs into different languages while keeping the artist's original singing style.\n\nCreate clean versions of songs by swapping out explicit lyrics.\n\nThis is an easy way to personalize or adapt music without needing the artist to re-record anything.\n\nThis process can currently be achieved through methods like recording a new version of the song with the desired lyrics and then use voice conversion, or through extensive audio editing and manual adjustments. However, my goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient approach that automates this process using AI, making it faster and more accessible while maintaining the quality and authenticity of the original performance.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear thoughts on whether this idea seems technically viable and if there‚Äôs a market for such a feature in the music or entertainment industries. Feedback and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

You can rule this use case right away.\\n\\nThe happy birthday use case is a gimmick at best. People will usually want their friend to know they think about them, not being lazy enough to recycle the same song over and over. I personally wouldn't appreciate it.\\n\\nIt leaves you with censorship. And I wonder where it applies and could be more useful than just a single beep.\\n\\nYep, sorry for the info, but this is both a lazy attempt at shoehorning AI in a use case and a doomed venture from the get go, since all your use cases have no real existence.\"]"

         "Quickly estimating the value of your startup equity",
         "Please, please, please... make sure you understand the potential value of your equity, whether you're currently employed at a startup or evaluating an offer letter. Here's a quick way to estimate your equity:\n\n1. **Estimate acquisition price (ARR x exit multiples)**\n   * Look up industry multiples. For B2B SaaS companies, typical exit multiples might be:\n      * Low end: 5√ó ARR\n      * Average: 10√ó ARR\n      * Good: 15√ó ARR\n      * Best-in-class: 20‚Äì25√ó ARR (often through strategic acquisitions)\n2. **Make an acquisition fee assumption**\n   * Assume 10% in fees. This covers costs like investment banking, due diligence, legal, and consulting fees. So, 10% will come off the top of the acquisition price\n3. **Look up equity capital raised**\n   * Equity capital raised is typically preferred equity, which gets paid back at sale to preferred shareholders (investors) before common shareholders see proceeds. This can be typically found online on Crunchbase or by adding up all the funding rounds\n4. **Determine your equity ownership**\n   * Divide your shares by the total fully diluted shares outstanding. Note: You likely do not have direct access to the cap table, but it is appropriate to ask for the # of shares outstanding when receiving an offer. If your a current employee, ask someone with access.\n5. **Calculate your cost to exercise**\n   * Multiply your shares by your strike price(s). This is what you'll pay to exercise your stock options. Note: I wont be discussing this in the post, but be mindful of AMT tax implications on the delta between the FMV and strike\n6. **Determine net gain or loss on equity**\n   * Equity value = (((Acquisition Price √ó (1 - Acquisition Fee %)) - Capital Raised) √ó Your Ownership %) - Cost to Exercise\n\n**Let's take a look at an example for B2B SaaS**\n\nDetails\n\n* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $20 million\n* Potential Exit Multiples: 5√ó, 10√ó, and 15√ó ARR\n* Acquisition Fees: 10% of acquisition price\n* Capital Raised: $80 million\n* Total Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted): 40 million shares\n* Your Shares: 175,000 shares\n* Your Ownership Percentage: 175,000 / 40,000,000 =0 .4375%\n* Strike Price per Share: $1.25\n* Cost to Exercise: 175,000¬†shares √ó $1.25 = $218,750\n\nCalculation (for 10x multiple estimate)\n\n* Company purchase price: $20m \\* 10m\n* Proceeds after fees: $200m √ó (1‚àí0.10) = $180m\n* Proceeds after paying back investors: $180m ‚àí$80m = $100m\n* Value of your equity: $100m √ó 0.4375% = $437.5k\n* Net gain/loss on equity (adjusted for exercise cost) = $437.5k ‚àí $218.75k = $218.75k\n\nNet gain or loss on equity\n\n|100m (5x ARR)|200m (10x ARR)|300m (15x ARR)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\-$175k|$218.75k|$612.5k|\n\nYes, you read that right, the employee actually lost money at the $100m exit, due to the capital raised and the cost to exercise exceeding your share of the proceeds. There are 100s of other variables that could influence your exit potential; that being said, this is a good general framework for getting a ballpark idea.",

Margins are secondary. \\n\\nWhat were total sales in 2021, 2022, 2023, and projected 2024?', '1. Mhmmm. can be a bit more challenging to sell a non-U.S. SaaS company, mostly because U.S. buyers often feel more comfortable with the legal and financial structures they‚Äôre used to. But if you have a high profit margin and stable revenue, it‚Äôs definitely still attractive‚Äîespecially to international buyers or U.S. buyers with global reach.  \\n  \\n2. Also, with a 90% profit margin and minimal founder input, you‚Äôre sitting on a valuable asset.

We officially opened for business on the day I started my job. \n\nMy complaints consist of: me not having an official title, my bosses unwillingness to become any sort of organized, all of our work having to come through me 1st due to my boss not wanting to pay for anyone else to have access to our software, I feel like often ppl are just waiting around on me because i'm crammed full of tasks that are more important than things like providing a cross reference part number for inventory, communication is never consistent, my boss likes to tell people important things verbally, he will randomly send an email or text, but it's never over one platform for easier documentation, he'll verbally tell our team something important that needs to get done, but because he's so overwhelmed with so many things, or won't get off of his phone to focus because he wants to be on call 24/7 for customers, it's completely incorrect information resulting in everyone else working harder &amp; unproductively on unimportant tasks, he consistently questions everything i'm doing as if he doesn't trust me, recently I needed to share something to our company drop-box &amp; I didn't have the admin permission to do it, not only did he deny me admin access to complete this task, but he also refused to attempt to add the documentations to the drop-box that I was unable to, these are just examples of things that happen often, unfortunately. \n\nMy responsibilities are:\n\nCreate PO's for Vendors, Create Jobs in our system for customers, print packing lists, receive packages in the system, create invoices for customers, input &amp; pay invoices for vendors. Keep products stocked, pull orders, maintain correct inventory in system, book freight pickup, answer phone calls, send order confirmations, ect. I wear just about every hat possible here.\n\n  \nI guess, I just want to know if this is normal &amp; should I expect it to get better? \n\nThere's no denying that we've been successful. My boss is amazing at sales. We're on the verge of being booked &amp; busy for the next 2 years. However, I feel like i'm fighting an uphill battle because the way my boss sees it is, he knew how to do everything &amp; was able to function \"fine\", so why should it change? None of our team can function this way. We're trying to improve now, but it's hard when resources are limited &amp; our boss complains about things like us organizing inventory, or pushes back on every single thing. It was a fight just to get inventory shelves. \n\nI feel if I was compensated more, it may all be worth it. But as of right now, i'm making $18 an hour with no benefits other than a week of sick time. Even if I needed insurance I wouldn't be able to afford it after bills. I just feel like it's not fair when i'm writing checks for my manager &amp; his business partner that are sometimes $25k in 2 months. \n\n  \nMaybe i'm a whiner &amp; not meant for this kind of work?

         "I am a PhD MBA candidate at a top university in aerospace graduating spring 2025 with an offer for $230k/y sal + $70k/yr equity with SpaceX or $275k at a defense tech growth-stage startup with some equity I'm not sure.\n\nI've recently been contacted by an EU foreign national to build X product to help Ukraine, something I certainly believe in. This is my bread-and-butter, unlike SpaceX (but the other company is similar). He mentioned in his first email that he was looking for a founding controls engineer, but when he saw my background he decided he was **considering co-founder**. He has great credentials\n\nHe says **he put in $250k** and has a product that looks good, and I think his idea is very good--I believe in the idea, but has significant amounts of technical debt. **He says his traction is a LOI** with the Ukrainian military and soldiers who want the device. I do not believe he can close the design and get the product to do all of X correctly by himself (probably can get it to do half of X), he's currently using hobby components, but he knows he will have to get serious about those things in the future. **He says he plans to raise $1.5 mil VC but no specific timeline or valuation**. On his slides, he says 50% of that will be for salaries. He does not seem to be working on the product, he mainly seems to be evaluating sites to build production later on, the complex physical product doesn't seem to have changed much in 6 months, but part of the software is getting better.\n\nWe spoke briefly and I passed a long series of technical checks with people he trusts, including people who build products similar to his. He threw out an offer of **15% + CTO + unspecified salary + move to UK or eastern Europe**, and we kind of mutually talked about about being lean as a founder on salary when you believe in the mission. It was kind of a spur of the moment \"gut check\" thing his father told him to do. I thanked him for the offer, told him I would consider it, and spoke with founders and staff here at my college to understand the offer and decide if it's worth it.\n\nBasically everyone I talked to said that what should be worth it for me would be 25%-30% + CTO + salary at 60% of my market rate. I decided, I guess for no reason, but to be nice to my potential founder and shot for 25% + CTO + cost of living + 60k salary, or an offer that was 25% + CTO + salary of 50% market or $150k. (I gave the COL offer because he's deciding whether or not to place the HQ in the UK or eastern European nations). I told him that basically, you know, founding a company is about trust and candor, so that's what I was thinking but I was very open to talking about it and seeing if we can reach a compromise. I basically targeted 25% 150k because **I was fine with 25% + $120k post-negotiation salary** or even lower but we would have to get into pro-forma to justify.\n\nI personally feel this is really fair for a \"gut check\" move across the world to join a startup with no complete product, no sales, and no raised funds besides his initial $250k. Equity-wise, I'm probably going to be deflated by the time we launch the first product, and there's so many market risks with the war in Ukraine.\n\nNot so to the potential cofounder. He said he and his other employee, someone on at \\~5%, are taking salaries of only $30k and he says that I have to weigh the mission--which I believe in--vs the better compensation of SpaceX, and he won't be able to get near SpaceX. He also mentioned he is reconsidering me for the CTO role because he's more worried about manufacture (downshift to founding engineer). He wants me to be involved with his team at a **low salary of $30k and no stated equity to see how we work together** (?) before making a vesting schedule and actually agreeing on equity.\n\nI basically told him that I wouldn't quit my PhD/MBA for that, nor move. You know, am I crazy? He is aware of cliffs and vesting, why doesn't he do that? I feel like, if we're successful, he's going to make a chunk of change, I'm going to make a little, and it's going to be very worth it for him, not so worth it for me.\n\nI basically said a CTO is a powerhouse all-star that can build the product without you in the loop if needed, e.g. when fundraising, and if I can't do that he fires me. Is that just America? Are the salaries that crazy different that $30k @ 15% is reasonable for a CTO to move across the world? I understand he put $250k in, but if I'm not getting any of it, why am I not at like 40-45%?\n\nTL;DR: Foreign co-founder has a half-product that I (PhD/MBA) can close, and wants me to move to his location and develop a product at 15% equity, $30k salary, when I have a great SpaceX offer. I like the startup space more and am highly motivated about the mission.",
         "[\"Take the space X gig. As an MBA at Phd level I'm surprised you are even asking this question. Having worked in defence in UK and still involved with defence consultancy.

If you can keep these other offers open for that time you can give it a go, why not.', \"Needs a TLDR, but from the first few sentences, as much as I hate Elon Musk, that salary they're offering you is huge for SpaceX.  Most people take pay cuts to work there.\", 'I think that 15% is reasonable.  The guy already has got a prototype and a LOI and is looking at production sites.  He has already got this thing pretty far.\\n\\nMakes sense you‚Äôd be scared to jump continents for something this uncertain, in which case just take the SpaceX job.  He will find someone else who has a higher risk appetite and is more passionate about the mission.', 'Guys SpaceX is not a good place to work.  You should literally find more than these two offers.', 'You‚Äôd be an idiot to take this ‚Äúcofounder‚Äù role over spaceX. Unless this guy is beating that offer with proof of funds and a signed contract, no fucking way.\\n\\nBesides all that, this guy is likely full of shit. If he was serious, he wouldn‚Äôt dodge basic questions and would be putting up way more than 30k and you‚Äôd be getting 30+% for a cofounder role.', 'Old guy perspective: Always get your career established first. With the experience of working in bigger teams. And some cash saved up (preferably also a owned home, with a low monthly cost).\\n\\nTreat the first 5-10 years in the workforce as continued studies, teaching you how to take advantage of the opportunities in a successful enough to grow startup. Including learning the different positions, preferably including some c-levels.\\xa0\\n\\nBefore 30 you shouldn‚Äôt join someone else‚Äôs startup, unless it‚Äôs a very very unique opportunity. Only do a startup if you for instance come out of uni with some new IP/research, and established patents.', 'The ukraine war wont last forever. Once it ends, your sales lines may die over night. You may also believe that your product solves their problems in the war or you have some viable solution however its inevitable that being cash strapped in a war, they will attempt to screw you and with being small players you will have little recompense.\\n\\nI would say SpaceX is the way to go, simply because the opportunities in the space area are only going to grow in the near future and nothing will be able to compete with it. \\n\\nThere is also significantly more room to grow in the SpaceX area and you will solve far more interesting problems.\\n\\nIf you still feel entrepreneurial you can always pivot from SpaceX into some other area, at which point you will have more skills and space will have grown overall. \\n\\nThink space tourism. We are quickly reaching the point where LEO will be more widely available', \"I'll add this to the other good advice here: being ex-SpaceX will do more for your reputation and network to help you fundraise for this (or future defense tech startups) than anything else.\", \"Just make sure you don't run afoul of ITAR while working with this cofounder. For all you know, he could be a bad actor from an unfriendly country.\", 'I‚Äôm Ukrainian and even I‚Äôll tell you to take SpaceX deal. You can help him and be a co-founder while working at SpaceX and agree to switch to full-time if he gets a contract.\\n\\nThere are plenty of good developers in Ukraine and plenty of projects already in flight - and they are struggling to get official contracts as military is spending money on ‚Äúproven‚Äù things instead of cool drone stuff. A lot of developers and engineers are also in the AFU and instead of fighting they develop drone recognition software or other soft/hardware improvements.\\n\\nHelping them as a side project might make more sense.', \"There are so many red flags that idk how you are considering this.\\n\\nReject this.

He should move some or it‚Äôs not worth it. He may be okay with $30k salary with higher equity. It‚Äôs reasonable for you to want $40k or $60k especially with lower equity.', \"The trial period makes sense and would be my recommendation for you too - work out some sort of trial project or trial period to do on contract with him, before committing to joining up with each other fully. That way you can see what working together is like and if it's something you want to do long term.\\n\\nThat said, his comp of $30k is crazy low. Maybe if he commits to pay raises pending his next round. Your offer of 22%/120k is super fair from a negotiation standpoint IMHO, especially given your other offer(s). OTOH 120k is half of their 250k resources, which is unfair to him. The 15% initial offer seems like a low-ball, though.\\n\\nSalaries are definitely lower in the EU in general\\n\\nA LOI is normally nothing - fairy dust. Nice to look at but has no substance. B2G is normally brutal due to the glacial pace that governments work at and all their procurement rules/processes. Ukraine/military is probably the one exception to that right now, since they're getting killed and would rather throw money/tech at their problems than bodies/lives. So that might actually be the best possible LOI to have in the world now. However, as another poster mentioned, it has an unknown expiry date if/when they lose.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that the business wouldn't stop at Ukraine, you'd use that as a stepping stone to sell to other countries. Some people have ethical concerns about working in the military industry.\\n\\nAre you crazy to leave the Space X and growth-stage offers? Yeah, obviously. But if you really want to follow your heart and do something crazy, there's room to finesse the negotiations and work something out that isn't a scam for either of you. I'd say define the trial period of work (probably time based, like the first semester of 2025 so you can go back to school if it's a no) and what deliverables you expect to get done (transitioning from prototype to final design, whatever else).\\n\\nThen consider what happens next - if you both say yes and you join as a co-founder, what's the salary and comp. His current offer is too low on both. Push him a bit to work on and seal his round. If he can say 'hot shot PHD under contract will be joining as CTO,' that's a good indicator to investors.\\n\\nIf he says no, he's basically firing you, so you should get some severance or additional compensation if he ends up selling your design/work. I'd think about a royalty, % up to a total sales value that might be acheivable in the first year or two. e.g. 5%, up to a max of 100k from the first $2 million in sales. You'd expect their product to evolve, so something super long term wouldn't be fair.\\n\\nIf you say no, similar situation, but you should probably ask for less in future earnings/royalty, since you're dipping out.\\n\\nMaybe ask around in your program. There are probably some profs/advisors with both startup and negotiation experience, right? But definitely don't jump fully in with some guy who sounds slightly full of shit, get a trial period for both of you to try the other one out first. And work together to find some mutual wins where you both feel like you ass is covered. And don't fuck up the spaceX thing too quickly, that sounds great too.\", 'LOI is not legally binding.

Our goal is to make that connection directly without the need for a middle-man.\n\nWe wouldnt get one type of user without the other so we scraped a bunch of these jobs for clinicians to view and request to apply to for free and got a little bit of traction but were struggling to get traction and in touch with the right people on the hospital side to work with us or at least provide some feedback. We know for a 100% fact they would benefit from this product though from past jobs but if it takes too long we dont want it to jeopardize our current users.\n\nAnyone have any tips for navigating the traditional \"which comes first, chicken or the egg\" scenario for a startup?
